analysis of GRBM
	present at CIFAR if possible
	try to prove that >2 collinear equiprobable modes are impossible
auxiliary variable ss sparse coding
	1. Understand Aaron's lyx file
	2. Code it up
	present at CIFAR
		RBM prior says features should be correlated based on weight directions -> bad
		Coates' work implies there should be an emphasis on encoding
estimation algorithms
	KL theory
		on binary data
			checkpoint = my e-mail w/subject "Binary KL guides features, not pmfs!"
			see how much any of this generalizes
		on continous data
			still possible we might be able to derive KL from
			score matching on continuous inputs

	status of currently existing estimators:
		smd: implemented and confident it works. see
		exploring_estimation_criteria/cifar_grbm_smd.yaml

		lnce: implemented and confident it works. not implemented as a
		pylearn2 cost.

		sm: implemented but slow (must use scan to compute each row
		of the hessian and then index out the diagonals of the
		hessian-- no good way of computing vector of second
		derivatives). could use optimization based on
		kevin swersky's paper to make it fast for models that can be
		converted to autoencoders.
		don't remember whether I was confident it works or not, could
		definitely use more testing

		nce: implemented and reasonably confident it works, could use
		some more testing.

	adding consistent estimators:
		try for example score matching + noise contrastive.

	LNCE:
		Is LNCE really consistent? I think not, the version of
		consistency we were using when we wrote that proof was weaker
		than Hyvarinen's definitions (need to check this). Also, I think the
		Bregman divergence paper's derivation of ratio matching lets
		us do a fixed version LNCE for the binary case (by sampling B
		matrices other than single bit flips). Comparing
		these may be helpful for deciding whether LNCE is consistent.
bilinear rbm
	figure out conditions needed for learning to do anything useful
	Aaron's approach with noise variables in the middle
	use slowness
	try a PSD version
SFA
	run Wiskott lab's code, see if their results are reproducible
	did Wiskott lab ever re-run their own code after fixing the bug I
	found?
	revisit ICML 11 code, try to get MLPs working better maybe using
	mu-ssRBM or score matching training
Contractive Sparse Coding
	Differentiable sparse coding is written up but slow. Haven't added the
	contractive terms.
Turn PSD into an EBM and sample from it
PMIL
	Rejected from UAI.
	Redo with flashier experiments, such as running it on video.

Dead ends:
	Reconstruction SRBM:
		The Reconstruction SRBM turns out to be just doing a directed
		model, generally equivalent to sparse coding (though sparse
		coding doesn't estimate the model with true maximum
		likelihood).

	Contractive coding:
		All ways that I tried to pose the problem ended up being
		differential equations that only had numerical solutions,
		even for extremely simple versions with only one hidden unit,
		etc.

	Deriving binary cross-entropy between data and autoencoder reconstruction
	as being some kind of consistent estimator:
		This is a dead end specifically for the case of binary input
		data. Autoencoder reconstruction is a function only of the
		model's score, and the pmf conveys no information about the
		score. Thus estimators based on the consistency of the
		recovered pmf are not able to influence the autoencoder
		reconstruction.

		This is not yet proven to be a dead end for the case of
		continous inputs.
