try out geodesic updates, haven't actually used them yet

difference between datasets-- could it be due to using float64 on gryphon and float32 in the lab?

some files, at least for gradient descent, show alpha increasing forever, and since the other parameters seem converged, this seems to be the only thing making the likelihood go down. should we do something about this?

extract features for random_patches_learned_prior, and for stl/C

lots of results have good reconstructions, so maybe not having enough sparsity?

run feature extraction and classification for cifar A5M
run feature extraction and classification for a high likelihood gradient descent-based model, even though the filters are ugly

letterbox free version of stl-10 and run it on D
get it working on other datasets
	MNIST: the problems so far may be due to centering by mean making the filters look funny
	Yoshua suggested: UTL, Shapeset 2x3, CIFAR-100
conjugate gradient E step
gradient based learning is not producing good filters. figure out why.
	gradient based learning does NOT drive W to zero... at least not all W
	one thing worth experimenting with is keeping old sufficient statistics around
	another is initializing W small
figure out if there's a faster way to calculate the M step gradient based on Aaron's idea
make something that shows activation boxes around the filters plotting p versus mean_h
maybe try training by initializing with random patches
experiment with keeping old sufficient statistics around on the solve M step

a lot of my current experiments are using only 1000 examples per batch to train 1600 examples. try using
    a larger batch size and see if that fixes things
    	-> STL A5 training on barney

if we freeze all but one parameter, we see that only W has the property of EM functional going up then tanking. resolve whether this is due to increased correlation in W making the E step fail, due to the M step normalization decreasing the EM functional, or some other problem.
	
benchmark the uses of scan. it seems like the runtime is not deterministic in some cases, ie sometimes I ran it and got a runtime of 30s/epoch and other times ran it and got 80s/epoch. maybe theano optimizations are chosen randomly and it gets dramatically different runtimes depending on which it chooses?


mystery of prior staying flat when some params are frozen: if mu is fixed to 0, weights have no effect on prior
slowdown bug. note: extracting stl A5M slowed down over time on sencha and oolong but not on bart7
