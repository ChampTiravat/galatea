Run scripts in this order:
spectral_terry
kmeans
extract_features

each has options that need to be set (hardcoded) at the top of the script
spectral_terry learns a spectral embedding on Yann's autoencoder features on terry, and makes a zip file that can be scored for the competition
kmeans loads the embedding features and learns k-means
extract_features takes the saved means and pulls out either a one-hot code or a triangle code, and makes a zip file that can be scored for the competition
